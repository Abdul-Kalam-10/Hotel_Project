In a Hotel Management System (HMS), the ability to order food is an essential feature for guests.
This module allows guests to place food orders for in-room dining or at the hotel's restaurants. 
Guests can browse the menu, view item details, and select the items they wish to order.
The system should allow guests to specify the quantity of each item they want to order.
As guests add items to their order, the system should calculate and display the real-time total cost.
Guests can review their complete order, including all selected items, quantities, and any customizations.
The system should maintain a history of past orders .
